 ### Enhanced Interactive Learning Assistant
An AI-driven educational assistant that personalizes learning by accepting user-defined topics and objectives, fetching content from various sources, and generating comprehensive, structured reports tailored to individual learning styles.

# Description
The Enhanced Interactive Learning Assistant is built to streamline personalized education. Users provide a topic and goal, and the system interacts with them to understand preferences and prior knowledge. It gathers content from simulated sources (web, video, academic), processes it, and presents a refined educational report including citations, visual aids, and further recommendations.

#  Features
Accepts topic, goal, interest, and preferred learning format

Gathers and processes content from:

üåê Web (via Wikipedia API)

üìΩÔ∏è Video (simulated transcript)

# Academic (simulated summary)

Personalized interaction based on:

Learning level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

Focus areas and preferences

Generates structured reports with:

Learning objectives

Summaries and references

Follow-up question support

(Planned) visual aids and diagrams

# Technology Stack

Layer	Tools/Tech Used
Frontend	Streamlit
Backend	Python 3.x

#  Setup
### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Enhanced-Interactive-Learning-Assistant.git
    cd Enhanced-Interactive-Learning-Assistant
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run learning_assistant_app.py
    ```

## System Architecture
The system is built using the following components:
- Streamlit: For the interactive user interface.
- Wikipedia API: For retrieving web content summaries.
- YouTube API (simulated): For fetching video transcripts (simulated in the code).
- Google Scholar API (simulated): For retrieving academic research summaries (simulated in the code).

The application allows users to input topics and learning goals, fetches relevant content from simulated sources, and generates a personalized learning report.
